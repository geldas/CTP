# CTP (Canadian Traveller Problem)

### Course VZI - Mathematical Principles of Computer Science
**Description**: The course provides students with the introduction to mathematical computer science. Formal languages and grammars and word processing tools in these languages are discussed.

### Problem description
[Canadian Traveller Problem (CTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_traveller_problem) is an optimization problem in which the graph is partially observed. That means that the path from node *i* to node *j* may be blocked. Whether the path is blocked or not is discovered, when the traveller reaches the node *i*. Traveller then chooses to find another road or pays the penalty for using blocked path (for example he waits until path is not blocked anymore).

### Project Description
Semestral Project. Application creates random graph with blocked paths. The user chooses start and end node end node and algorithm to solve the problem. Several non-heuristic methods were programmed: **Greedy**, **Reposition**, **Comparison**, **Waiting** and **Recovery-Greedy**.

The main goal of the project is to use or implement non-trivial data structure. The idea is to implement own **Binary Heap** data structure in **Dijkstra algorithm**.
